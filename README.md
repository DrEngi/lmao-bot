Lmao-bot is a fun, multipurpose bot meant to replace people's asses when they say "lmao" or "lmfao". It also serves as a utility bot with music, moderation commands, probability commands (including coins, dice, cards, and 8-ball), and custom message commands.

When someone says "lmao" or "lmfao" in the chat, the bot responds with the following message:

> You appear to have misplaced your ass while laughing. Here is a replacement: 🍑

This message, along with the automatic 🍑 reactions the bot gives, can be disabled or made to happen randomly instead of all the time. I personally recommend setting the chance to 1%, especially if you're on an active server, so that it's always unexpected when the message comes.

The bot was created in June 2018 by Firestar493#6963 with help from DrEngineer#8214. Its prefix is "lmao", but the prefix can be changed from server to server. In May & June of 2019, the bot was rewritten in C#. Contributions are encouraged.
